# Overview
This repo pertains to [fly.io's distributed systems
challenge](https://fly.io/dist-sys/) and gets its name from the Magic: the
Gathering plane Alara (the application used to test fly.io's challenges is
called Maelstrom). The implementation of the protocol used in the challenges is
also present as a stand-alone library, `aurora`.

There are many different ways the protocol can be implemented. For various
reasons, `aurora` is implemented with `async`.

# Using & Contributing
Because these challenges are meant to be learning exercises, everything in this
repo is under an AGPL license. If you use `aurora`, tweak it, or build on top
of it, please make those changes publicly available under the same license.
